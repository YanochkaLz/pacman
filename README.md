Pac-Man is a classic arcade game created by Namco and first released in 1980. It quickly became one of the most popular and iconic video games of all time. The game is set in a maze where the player controls a character named Pac-Man, a yellow round creature with a big mouth. The goal of the game is to guide Pacman through the maze, eating all the dots and avoiding colorful ghosts in the process.

The maze is filled with dots, energy pellets, and various fruits that periodically appear. As you make your way through the maze, Pacman must collect all the dots to complete each level. There are also cherries that speed up the character by 15 seconds.

The gameplay becomes increasingly difficult as you progress through the levels. The ghosts become faster and more aggressive, so it becomes harder for Pacman to avoid them. In addition, the layout of the maze changes, and new obstacles and patterns appear.
